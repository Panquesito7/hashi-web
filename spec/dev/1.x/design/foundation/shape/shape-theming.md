# Shape Theming
Hashi's guidelines for applying shape values on a global scope.

## Shape Properties
### Radius
Hashi's radius theming has three main properties: small, medium, and large. The distinctions are made based on component sizes (i.e. Buttons are small components, therefore its radius value is the `small-radius` value.).

#### What can we consider as x component size?
| Size   | Example components                                                               |
|--------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Small  | Buttons, Badges, Text Fields, Select Fields, Links, Form Controls, Tags, Wallets |
| Medium | Cards, Modals, Profiles, Banners, Feature Cards                                  |
| Large  | Headers, Appbars, Navbars, Drawers, Hero Sections, etc.                          |
