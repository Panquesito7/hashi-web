Hashi's color system is divided into three scopes: Global,  Hashi's color system only utilizes the limited amount of color tokens we have provided. This ensures consistent interfaces throughout the ecosystem.

## Scopes
Hashi's color system has two main properties: Primary, Accent, and Background.

### Primary Colors
These colors define the majority of surfaces in the interface. These consist of cards, profiles, etc. The primary color property takes in a map with the 4-shade schema.

### Accent Colors
These colors define user-interactable elements of the interface. These consist of buttons and button groups, form field and select field accent colors, etc. The accent color property takes in a map with the 4-shade schema.

### Background Color
The background color serves as the main surface area the elements will be placed on. The background color property only takes one immutable color for both light and dark mode.
