# Hashi Tokens

Tokens are the heart and soul of the design system, hence, they are one of the most valuable assets. These are your source of truth and provides a centralized repository of design constants that will be used throughout the design system.

One of the philosophies applied to this is that these are the building blocks for creating components. We encourage you to use Hashi's token API to style your components.

export const TokenCard = ({ color, to, children }) => {
    return (
        <a href={ `/docs/0.1.5/core/tokens/${to}` }>
            <div className={`hs-doc-card bg-${color}`}>
                <h3>{ children }</h3>
            </div>
        </a>
    )
}

Below are the documented essential tokens.

<section class="grid">
    <TokenCard to="color-tokens" color="scarlet-400">Color</TokenCard>
    <TokenCard to="shape-tokens" color="native-blue-400">Shape</TokenCard>
    <TokenCard to="typography-tokens" color="plox-400">Typography</TokenCard>
