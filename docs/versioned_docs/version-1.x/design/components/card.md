## Content Guidelines
The card is a blank surface component, technically you can put anything in there. However, there's a certain hierarchy we want to point out whenever you're creating card content:
1. The card actions (usually buttons) are placed at the card footer (the bottom part of the card).
2. All the titular information (title, subtitle, icons, images, etc.) are placed on the top
    - The order is as follows: Title, Subtitle, Image, Icon.
3. All the content inside the card should not overflow the container.
