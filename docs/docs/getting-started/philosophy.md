# Philosophy
The Hashi Design System follows a modified version of the token-driven philosophy. Wherin we will only use tokens for property values and will only compromise if needed.

This token-driven approach allows us to be consistent throughout the Dev Protocol ecosystem.

In conjunction to the design system being token driven, we also reduced the components to being small/primitive only. This allows space for the project to solve their own specific design problems that would've otherwise caused clutter, chaos, and duplicated code in both the design system and the said project.

The design system also follows the base-variance pattern, this has proven to be (according to AirBnb) a very effective method in solving design consistency while having the flexibility to solve a project's own design problems.
