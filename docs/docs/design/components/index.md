Hashi’s component system is designed to be primitive only and not provide everything. We believe that each project has its own design problems, and there is no “one solution” to the said problems.

## Creating your own components

Designers are free to make their own components to solve their project’s own, and self-contained design problems. However, to maintain consistency designers must use only the provided values inside the tokens page.

Components can be shared among projects if a project so wishes to use a component used from another project.

The provided primitive components can also be used in the aforementioned project-specific components.
