Colors are one of the visual blocks of Hashi. It indicates surface hierarchy, states, intent, and more. However, one does not simply apply the color to a surface, it needs to have intent. We have a few guidelines set in place to help you design interfaces that are expressive, accessible, and meaningful.

## Anatomy
When we build interfaces, we mainly divide color in two different kinds: primary, and secondary. Primary colors serve as the color of surfaces (e.g. bards, backgrounds, profiles, etc.). Secondary colors are applied to action/interactive elements (e.g. buttons, links, text fields, select fields, form controls, etc.).

The intent of the contrast is for visual hierarchy, and accessibility. The interactive elements tend to stand out more from the surface colors hence the differentiation.

Of course, we can't forget about accessibility. We generally want a really contrasting color for inks if the surface is a filled surface. AA contrast rating is recommended.

## Restrictions
We have placed a restriction to only used the provided token colors, and the designer is not allowed to change shades, tints, and the color itself. This lets us have consistent branding colors throughout the ecosystem.

In the v1.x specs, we are working on tone extensions to expand the available color palette.
