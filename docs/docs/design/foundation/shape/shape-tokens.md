# Shape Token System
What constitutes as a shape token is whenever the value is related to the component's structure (e.g. radius, spacing,
etc.). Hashi's shape tokens also follow a specific schema. Each shape token increments by adding 0.2rem to 0.3rem to its
amount, or by doubling it from the previous token value. The values are labeled by size (xs â†’ xl), however the
label `pill` is reserved for creating pill-shaped components (i.e. pill-shaped buttons).

| Label | Value            |
|-------|------------------|
| none  | 0                |
| xs    | +0.2rem          |
| sm    | +0.4rem or (xs)2 |
| md    | +0.6rem or (sm)2 |
| lg    | +0.8rem or (md)2 |
| xl    | +1rem or (lg)2   |
| pill  | 600px            |

## Extending Shape Tokens
### Escape Hatch Shape Tokens

Escape hatch shape tokens are tokens that are not within the given in the default shape token set. Keep in mind that **as much as possible, use the provided shape tokens instead of creating your own**, this guideline is only provided as an "escape hatch" if the provided shape tokens don't work.

Escape hatch shape tokens have a limit to how many you can have. Generally we only allow 1 to 2 presets to avoid complete deviation.
