# Hashi Token System
Hashi uses tokens to enforce consistency throughout the ecosystem via the smallest of design units. 

Generally, Hashi uses two types of tokens: Primitive Tokens, and Theme Tokens. Primitive tokens are not accessed directly. These are values with no semantic meaning to them. 

Primitive tokens include recommended raw color values, spacing values, etc.

On the other hand, theme tokens don't have an exact value, but instead these are using primitive tokens for their values. These are the tokens that are directly used in the design system.

Theme tokens include theme colors (refer to [this page](./color/color-tokens.md)), theme typography (refer to [this page](./typography/typography-tokens.md)).
