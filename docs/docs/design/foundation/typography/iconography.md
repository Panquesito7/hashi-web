# Iconography
Icons are a vital part of improving the user experience in a project. It lets users determine the function, intent, and meaning of the action/information by looking at one glyph.

## Guidelines
We've divided allowed icons by their purpose. There are only a few icon libraries you're allowed to use.

| Purpose                 | Icon Libraries                           |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| General                 | Font Awesome Icons                       |
| External Brand/Logo     | SimpleIcons                              |
| Dev Protocol Brand      | Refer to Dev Protocol's branding section |

### Sizing
Generally, icon sizes only revolve around 22px to 28px depending on the component size.

| Component Size | Icon Size |
|----------------|-----------|
| Small          | 22px      |
| Medium         | 25px      |
| Large          | 28px      |

However, this rule can be broken whenever used next to a standalone typography element (like a Supertitle). In these cases, the icon sizes are the same as the typography size.

### Spacing
Whenever the icon is placed next to a text, the space between the two is `4px` minimum.
