# Typography Token System
Typography tokens are values that have to do with fonts, from the size and weights, to the leading and spacing. Like the
other two, this also follows a particular schema.

| Type       | Size (px) | Leading (px) | Default Weight |
|------------|-----------|--------------|----------------|
| Supertitle | 42        | 60           | 700            |
| Title      | 36        | 40           | 700            |
| Subtitle   | 24        | 30           | 700            |
| Body       | 16        | 24           | 400            |
| Mono       | 16        | 24           | 400            |
| Small      | 12        | 20           | 400            |
